Project Despribtion: Our objective is to build a predictive model that uses multi-variable features, as found in the dataset, to assess the risk of OCD within the general population. By identifying patterns and risk factors associated with OCD, this model could serve as a valuable tool in both prevention and intervention efforts. Specifically, the model will aid in the early identification of individuals who are at a heightened risk of developing OCD, enabling the implementation of targeted prevention strategies using existing mental health guidelines. Additionally, for those already diagnosed, the model can support the creation of personalised action plans, optimising treatment and management based on their unique profiles. This approach not only enhances the effectiveness of interventions but also contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of OCD and its underlying causes, ultimately improving outcomes for those affected by the disorder. The findings could have significant implications for public health strategies aimed at reducing the incidence and impact of OCD.
