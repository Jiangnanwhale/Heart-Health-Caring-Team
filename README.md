## Project Despribtion
This project aims to tackle the challenge of predicting depression comorbidity among OCD patients. By utilising a dataset, the goal is to develop a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of depression and recommend appropriate treatments. It will specifically use sociological factors such as marital status, family history of OCD, and education level as well as Y-BOCS score showing the OCD severity level. This will facilitate the early identification of individuals at high risk of developing depression, allowing for the implementation of targeted prevention strategies or intervention based on established mental health guidelines.
