## Project Despribtion
The Heart Failure Mortality Prediction project aims to build a web-based medical dashboard that supports physicians to predict the risk of mortality due to heart failure. Physicians will be able to reassess treatment plans, explore alternative therapies, and closely monitor patients to help mitigate the risk of mortality. Prescriptive analytics will be used on patient data to help physicians identify specific factors contributing to elevated mortality risk. Thus, it will provide recommendations based on existing medical guidelines to guide in clinical decision-making on an individual basis for prevention and/or mitigation of mortality due to heart failure.
